The OpenMV project aims at making machine vision more accessible to hobbyists and makers by making open-source, low-cost machine vision cameras. The OpenMV project was successfully funded via Kickstarter back in 2013. The first generation of OpenMV cameras is based the STM's STM32F ARM Cortex-M MCUs and Omnivision OV7725 sensors.

OpenMV cameras are programmable in Python3 and come with an extensive set of image processing functions such as face detection and tracking, keypoints descriptor, color blob tracking, QR and Bar codes support, GIF and MJPEG recording and much more.

The OpenMV camera board has built-in RGB and IR LEDs, USB FS for programming and video streaming, uSD socket and I/O headers breaking out PWM, UARTs, SPI and I2C. Additionally, OpenMV supports extension modules (shields) using the I/O headers such as WiFi, BLE, Thermal (FIR) and LCD shields.

OpenMV comes with a cross-platform IDE (based on QT creator) designed specifically to support OpenMV cameras. The IDE allows viewing the frame buffer, accessing sensor controls, uploading scripts and running them on the camera via serial over USB (or WiFi/BLE if available).
